## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> - The database installation step only needs to be completed once, even if you are using multiple faz-bot components.
> - This manual is made for Linux. Might require more steps if you are running Windows.

### Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) (if not using docker)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (if using docker)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository
    
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/FAZuH/faz-bot-app-discord
    ```

    Change directory into the repository with `cd faz-bot-app-discord`.

2. Set environment variables

    Copy with `cp .env-example .env`, and fill the placeholders in `.env`.

3. Initialize the database
    
    **Non-docker**
   - Download and install MySQL. Make sure your MySQL server is up and running.
   - Run `uv run faz-initdb` to initialize the database.
   
    **Docker**
   - Run `docker compose up --detach mysql` to pull a mariadb docker image, and run a container from it. This should also create a "mysql" volume and "faz-bot-network" network for the docker containers.
   - Run `uv run faz-initdb` to initialize the database.

## Usage

**Non-docker** Run the app with `uv run faz-bot-discord`.

**Docker** Run the app with `docker compose up --detach faz-bot-discord`

## Notes and Tips

- Application logs are stored on `logs` directory, in the root of the repository.
- If you are using docker, you can find where docker is storing your mysql volume data with `docker inspect volume mysql`.
